# AI & Application Development

This is my capstone project for [Python Project for AI & Application Development](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-project-for-ai-application-development)


## Project story
You are working for an IT services company and your company has just won a big project with an hotel in Quebec, Canada serving customers with a large French-speaking population. While most communication will happen in English, there is a scope for personal touch if French is used in communication. You are going to develop some chatbots for the client. The chances that the customer base the client is dealing with is largely French-speaking is high. So you would like to develop a server with end points that allow you to translate from English to French and from French to English.

You are given a skeleton structure, on top which you are expected to build the functionality.
